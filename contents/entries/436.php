wondershaper is a traffic shaping script that provides low latency, prioritizes bulk transfers below normal web traffic, prioritizes
       interactive  shells  above  normal  web traffic, and attempts to prevent upload and download traffic from affecting each other's ack
       packets.  Put simply, the wondershaper makes your internet connection more "responsive"
